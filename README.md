## Overview

🌐 This repository is a **consolidated resource hub**, meticulously curated for students of the **Mathematics and Computer Science** bachelor's degree at "Babeș-Bolyai" University. It streamlines various academic materials across different academic years and semesters, providing a systematic and user-friendly navigation experience.

## Usage Guidelines
📑 To harness this repository efficiently:

- **Yearly Overview**: Navigate to the desired academic year directory, i.e., "First Year", "Second Year" or "Third Year".
  
- **Semester Selection**: Choose either "Semester 1" or "Semester 2" within the respective academic year.
  
- **Course Categorization** - in this repository, courses are classified into **three main types**. Each course listed in this repository will fall into one of these categories, helping students quickly determine its relevance and significance to their academic progression:
  
    - **Mandatory courses (Cursuri obligatorii)**: These are the _core courses_ that every student **must undertake** and pass in order to graduate from the program. They form the foundation of the _Mathematics and Computer Science_ BSc and are non-negotiable in terms of enrollment.
    - **Electives (Cursuri optionale)**: While these courses are also essential for graduation, there's a degree of flexibility here. Students have the option to switch between electives, provided they are within the same faculty and carry an equivalent credit value. Electives allow students to tailor their educational experience more closely to their interests, while still adhering to the overall program requirements.
    - **Optional courses (Cursuri facultative)**: These are supplementary courses designed to broaden a student's knowledge and expertise. While they are not mandatory for graduation, they provide students with the opportunity to explore topics beyond the core curriculum, thereby enriching their academic journey.
      
- **Retrieve Academic Resources** - Each course in this repository, whether _mandatory_, _elective_, or _optional_, is structured to potentially contain the following components:
   <br> 📖 **Bibliography**: Suggested and required readings related to the course, as well as direct sources which might be cited in the other categories below. 
   <br> ✍🏼 **Class Notes**: Personal notes and important highlights from the classes.
   <br> 📝 **Seminaries**: Seminar notes, presentations, homework and related resources.
   <br> 🔬 **Laboratories**: Notes, exercises, and projects related to lab sessions.
   <br> 🔎 **Extra Work/Practice Exercises**: Additional practice problems and solutions to enhance understanding.
   <br> 🛠️ **Resources/Tools**: Tools, software, and other helpful resources related to the course content.

<br> 🔷 **Important**: Please note that **not every course** will have all these components. Some might be absent due to the nature of the course or the resources available at the time. 🔷
